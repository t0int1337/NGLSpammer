# NGLSpammer
A spammer for NGL (ngl.link)

## Made by t0int
Thanks for using this! If you have any questions, feel free to contact me on Discord: @t0int 


### Warning!
The username must be the username inside the link, not the username of the person who created the link. <br>
For example:<br>
https://ngl.link/adam17104<br>
On this text the username is **adam17104**

### How to avoid CloudFlare
This project already uses Cloudscrape which allows the script to post the messages better
But when you spam a lot of text you can get detected. (It's not permanent)
